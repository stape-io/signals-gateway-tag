# Signals Gateway Pixel by Stape for Google Tag Manager Web

The **Signals Gateway Pixel by Stape** tag integrates the Signals Gateway Pixel into your website via Google Tag Manager Web container, which allows for a more resilient tracking setup by sending events through a first-party endpoint. It supports sending standard or custom events to your Signals Gateway, including enhanced conversions and user data for improved attribution.

## How to Use

1. Add the **Signals Gateway Pixel by Stape** tag to your Web GTM container.
2. Enter the **Signals Gateway Pixel ID**, **Signals Gateway Pixel Script Host** and **Signals Gateway Pixel Script URL**.
3. Choose how the **Event Name** is defined:
   - **Inherit from Data Layer** - maps GTM/GA4 event names to Meta equivalents.
   - **Override** - choose from standard events or provide a custom event name.
4. Enable **Automatic Data Layer Mapping** (recommended) to parse GA4, UA, and Common Event Data formats.
5. (Optional) Enable **Advanced Matching** to securely pass user data (e.g., email, phone) to Meta for better match rates.
6. (Optional) Enable **Event Enhancement** to store and reuse user data via `localStorage` across sessions.
7. (Optional) Configure **Consent Settings** using either GTM Consent Mode or manual control.
8.  (Optional) Activate **Limited Data Use (LDU)** for California data compliance and specify Country/State codes.
9.  (Optional) Enable **Server-Side Tracking Support** using Event ID and Data Layer push for deduplication with Conversions API or Signals Gateway Pixel.
10. Adjust **Settings** for automatic configuration (automatic events collection, such as button clicks and page metadata capture) and history event tracking (mainly for SPA websites).

## Event Name Setup Options

- **Standard Events** (when overriding):
  - `PageView`, `AddToCart`, `Purchase`, `Lead`, `ViewContent`, etc.
- **Inherit from Client** (default):
  - Maps GA4 events like `purchase`, `add_to_cart`, `sign_up`, etc. to Meta equivalents.

## Required Fields
- **Signals Gateway Pixel ID**
- **Signals Gateway Pixel Host**
- **Signals Gateway Pixel Script URL**

## Features

### Advanced Matching

Securely enrich events with **user identifiers** such as:
- **Email** (`em`)
- **Phone** (`ph`)
- **Name, Address, External ID**, and more

Meta recommends hashing PII using SHA256. The tag will hash values if not already hashed.

- User data can be sourced from:
  - Manually entered table
  - Data Layer (`user_data`)
  - Custom variable (e.g., User-Provided Data Variable)

### Event Enhancement

When enabled, user data is stored in `localStorage` to persist across events and sessions. It improves match quality for repeat or multi-page actions.

### Consent Settings

Support for:
- **GTM Consent Mode** — respects `ad_storage` signals.
- **Manual Consent Check** — prevent tracking until explicit approval.
- **Limited Data Use (LDU)** — for U.S. states with data restrictions.

### Server-Side Deduplication

If using both client- and server-side Meta tracking:
- Use **Event ID** to deduplicate conversions.
- Enable **DataLayer Push** with a matching event name and object for synchronization.

### Object and Event Properties

Send additional metadata via:
- **Object Properties Table**
- **Data Layer Mapping** (GA4)
- **Custom Variable (JavaScript Object)**

Includes support for:
- `value`, `currency`, `content_ids`, `contents`, `num_items`, and others depending on ecommerce format.

### Other Settings

- Disable automatic `cbq('set','autoConfig')`, which disables automatic events such as button clicks and page metadata capture.
- Disable PageView automatic tracking on SPA websites.
